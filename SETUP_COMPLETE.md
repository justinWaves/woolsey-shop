### 🔄 Next Steps (Ready When You Are)

1. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000 - The site will work once you have products in Shopify!

2. **Add Products to Shopify**
   - Create products with variants (Size: S, M, L, XL)
   - Add multiple images per product
   - Create collections for each artist
   - Publish products to your custom app's sales channel

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Import to Vercel
   - Add environment variables (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - Deploy!

4. **Set Up Webhooks** (Optional but recommended)
   - Configure webhooks in Shopify to auto-update the site
   - See DEPLOYMENT.md for full instructions

## Important Notes

### Environment Variables Required

Your `.env.local` should have:
```env
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-07
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Build Note
The production build (`npm run build`) requires the Shopify env vars to be set because it fetches data at build time. If you see build errors about missing env vars, that's expected - the build will work once:
1. You have products in Shopify
2. Your env vars are properly set

In production on Vercel, this will work automatically with your configured environment variables.

## Design System

### Colors
- **Accent**: Electric Blue (#5E8BF7) - Change in `globals.css`
- **Background**: White (light) / #0A0A0A (dark)
- **Surface**: #F6F7F9 (light) / #111315 (dark)

### Typography
- **Display**: Space Grotesk (headlines, product titles)
- **Body**: Inter (paragraphs, UI)

### Customization
All design tokens are in `src/app/globals.css` - easy to modify!

## How Product Sharing Works

Each product page has:
- **Unique URL**: `/product/[handle]` (e.g., `/product/festival-tee`)
- **Open Graph tags**: Shows product image, title, description when shared
- **Direct checkout**: "Buy Now" button redirects to Shopify checkout
- **ISR caching**: Fast loading, auto-revalidates every hour

Perfect for sharing on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc!

## Routes Overview

| Route | Purpose | ISR |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `/` | Home page with featured products/artists | 1 hour |
| `/shop` | All products grid | 1 hour |
| `/artists` | All artists/collections | 1 hour |
| `/collections/[handle]` | Individual artist page with their products | 1 hour |
| `/product/[handle]` | Product detail with checkout | 1 hour |
| `/api/revalidate` | Webhook endpoint for cache updates | N/A |

## Performance Features

- **ISR**: Static pages that auto-refresh
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading, responsive sizes
- **Edge-ready**: Can deploy to edge with minimal changes
- **Minimal JS**: Client components only where needed
- **Webhook revalidation**: Updates without waiting for cache expiry
